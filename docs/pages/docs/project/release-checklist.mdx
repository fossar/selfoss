1. Update `NEWS.md` with highlights of changes that are not yet there. Set a release date.
2. Update the version strings throughout the code base to the new release using `npm run bump-version 2.19` and commit the changes.
3. Commit the changes.
4. Create a tag using `git tag 2.19`.
5. Push the tag to GitHub `git push origin master --tags`, GitHub actions will automatically build the release tarball and publish the release on GitHub.
6. After the tarball is available, run `zola build` in the `docs/` directory and upload the generated contents of `docs/public` to the website.
7. Change the versions to new snapshot `npm run bump-version 2.20-SNAPSHOT`, commit the changes, and push them to the repo to start a new cycle.
