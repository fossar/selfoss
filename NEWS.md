### Bug fixes
- Reddit spout allows wider range of URLs, including absolute URLs and searches ([#1033](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1033))
- Improved compatibility with PHP 7.2 ([#1049](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/issues/1049))
- `logger_level=NONE` is now handled correctly ([#1077](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/issues/1077))
- URLs containing special characters like commas in query string are now handled correctly ([#1082](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1082))
- Set 60 second timeout to spout HTTP requests to prevent a single feed blocking other updates ([#1104](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/issues/1104))
- Significantly improved accessibility ([#1133](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1133), [#1134](https://github.com/SSilence/selfoss/pull/1134) and [#1141](https://github.com/SSilence/selfoss/pull/1141))
- Fixed marking more than 1000 items as read at the same time ([#1182](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/issues/1182))
- Fixed loading full text on pages containing ampersands in URLs ([#1188](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1188))
- Fixed missing styling in article contents ([#1221](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1221))
- Golem, Lightreading and Heise spouts now use Graby for extracting article contents instead of our own defunct extraction rules. ([#1245](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1245))
- The tag colour picker now pre-selects the current colour instead of a placeholder colour. ([#1269](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1269))

### API changes
- `tags` attribute is now consistently array of strings, numbers are numbers and booleans are booleans. **This might break third-party clients that have not updated yet.** ([#948](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/948))
- API is now versioned separately from selfoss and follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) ([#1137](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1137))
- *API 2.21.0*: `/mark` now accepts list of item IDs encoded as JSON. Requests using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` are deprecated. ([#1182](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1182))
- Dates returned as part of items now strictly follow ISO8601 format. ([#1246](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1246))

### Customization changes
- `selfoss.shares.register` changed its signature: it no longer takes a boolean argument, and the callback is expected to open a window itself, instead of returning a URL. The `register` method now also expects a label and a HTML code of an icon (you can use a `<img>` tag, inline `<svg>`, emoji, etc.).

  To demonstrate, if you previously had

  ```javascript
  selfoss.shares.register('moo', 'm', true, function(url, title) {
      return 'http://moo.foobar/share?u=' + encodeURIComponent(url) + '&t=' + encodeURIComponent(title);
  });
  ```

  in your `user.js` file, you will need to change it to

  ```javascript
  selfoss.shares.register('moo', 'Share using Moo', 'm', 'üöõ', function(data) {
      window.open('http://moo.foobar/share?u=' + encodeURIComponent(data.url) + '&t=' + encodeURIComponent(data.title));
  });
  ```

  or if your browser supports it, simply

  ```javascript
  selfoss.shares.register('moo', 'Share using Moo', 'm', 'üöõ', ({url, title}) => {
      window.open(`http://moo.foobar/share?u=${encodeURIComponent(url)}&t=${encodeURIComponent(title)}`);
  });
  ```

  ([#1017](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1017), [#1035](https://github.com/SSilence/selfoss/pull/1035))
- Custom FullTextRss filter were moved to `fulltextrss` directory in data directory ([#1043](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1043))
- Spouts can now implement `getSourceIcon()` instead of `getIcon()` when icon is associated with the feed, not individual icons. ([#1190](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1190))
- Some language files have been renamed to use correct [IETF language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) and you might need to change the `language` key in your `config.ini`:
  * Simplified Chinese `zh-CN`
  * Traditional Chinese `zh-TW`
  * Norwegian Bokm√•l `nb`
  * Swedish `sv`
- Wallabag sharer now targets Wallabag 2 by default. This is potentially breaking change but hopefully, no one uses Wallabag 1 any more. ([#1261](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1261))
- `defaults.ini` file is no longer used, it is only provided for convenience under a new name `config-example.ini` ([#1261](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1261), [#1267](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1267))

- More of user interface is now translatable ([#1054](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1054))
- Open Sans font is no longer bundled, resulting in smaller installations. Additionally, `use_system_font` option was removed. The typeface is still set as the default font family, so if you want to use it, install it to your devices.

- Developers, we are now building the styles and client-side code statically, using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). If you update any such assets, you will need to run `npm run build` for the changes to be reflected. You can also use `npm run dev` to watch for asset changes. ([#1137](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1137))
- Developers, CSS files are now checked using [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) and formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). You can use `npm run lint:styles` and `npm run fix:styles` respectively in the `assets` directory to run those tools. ([#1153](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1153))
- Google+ and del.icio.us share button were removed ([#1121](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1121))

- RSS spout now prefers the feed logo to website favicon. ([#1152](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1152))
- RSS spout now tries to use favicon from the feed domain when there is no logo or home page favicon. ([#1152](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1152))
- Setting `DEBUG` to `1` in `src/common.php` no longer logs HTTP bodies, only headers. Set it to `2` if you need the bodies as well. ([#1152](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1152))
- The debugging level (previously set by modifying `src/common.php`) can be changed in the `config.ini` using `debug` key. ([#1261](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1261))
- In order to support offline mode, we moved much of the UI to the browser. ([#1150](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1150), [#1184](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1184), [#1215](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1215), [#1216](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1216))
- We carried out a significant internal refactoring ([#1164](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1164), [#1190](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1190))
- Removed Instapaper spout since it has been broken since its acquisition. Sources using it were migrated to ‚ÄúRSS Feed (with content extraction)‚Äù. ([#1245](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1245))
- Placeholders are now used for images before they are loaded to avoid content jumping around ([#1204](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1204))
- Search button is now always on the screen, avoiding the need to scroll to top to be able to use it. ([#1231](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/issues/1231))
- Button for opening articles, tags, sources and filters in the sidebar, as well as the source and tag links in articles are now real links, allowing to open them in a new tab by middle-clicking them. ([#1216](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/issues/1216), [#695](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/issues/695))
- [F3 framework](https://fatfreeframework.com) is no longer used. So long‚Ä¶ ([#1261](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1261), [#1295](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1295), [#1296](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1296))
