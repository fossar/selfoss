- Fixed missing styling in article contents ([#1221](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1221))
- Golem, Lightreading and Heise spouts now use Graby for extracting article contents instead of our own defunct extraction rules. ([#1245](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1245))
- The tag colour picker now pre-selects the current colour instead of a placeholder colour. ([#1269](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1269))
- OPML import now correctly handles valid files. ([#1366](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1366))
- OPML import will prefer `title` attribute over text for feed names. ([#1366](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1366))
- OPML import is now able to read files when the browser sends an incorrect MIME type. ([#1366](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1366))

### API changes
- `tags` attribute is now consistently array of strings, numbers are numbers and booleans are booleans. **This might break third-party clients that have not updated yet.** ([#948](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/948))
- API is now versioned separately from selfoss and follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) ([#1137](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1137))
- *API 2.21.0*: `/mark` now accepts list of item IDs encoded as JSON. Requests using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` are deprecated. ([#1182](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1182))
- Dates returned as part of items now strictly follow ISO8601 format. ([#1246](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1246))
- The following are deprecated and will be removed in next selfoss version:
  - Passing credentials in query string, use cookies instead. ([#1360](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1360))
  - `GET /login` endpoint, use `POST /login`. ([#1360](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1360))
  - `GET /logout` was deprecated in favour of newly introduced (*API 4.1.0*) `DELETE /api/session/current`. ([#1360](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1360))
  - `POST /source/delete/:id` in favour of `DELETE /source/:id`. ([#1360](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1360))
- *API 6.0.0*: Makes the `author` field `null` when an item author is not known ([#1367](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1367))

### Customization changes
- `selfoss.shares.register` was removed. Instead you should set `selfoss.customSharers` to an object of *sharer* objects. The `action` callback is now expected to open a window on its own, instead of returning a URL. A label and a HTML code of an icon (you can use a `<img>` tag, inline `<svg>`, emoji, etc.) are now expected.

  To demonstrate, if you previously had

  ```javascript
  selfoss.shares.register('moo', 'm', true, function(url, title) {
      return 'http://moo.foobar/share?u=' + encodeURIComponent(url) + '&t=' + encodeURIComponent(title);
  });
  ```

  in your `user.js` file, you will need to change it to

  ```javascript
  selfoss.customSharers = {
      'm': {
          label: 'Share using Moo',
          icon: 'üöõ',
          action: ({url, title}) => {
              window.open(`http://moo.foobar/share?u=${encodeURIComponent(url)}&t=${encodeURIComponent(title)}`);
          },
      },
  };
  ```

- Custom FullTextRss filter were moved to `fulltextrss` directory in data directory ([#1043](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1043))
- Spouts can now implement `getSourceIcon()` instead of `getIcon()` when icon is associated with the feed, not individual icons. ([#1190](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1190))
- Some language files have been renamed to use correct [IETF language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) and you might need to change the `language` key in your `config.ini`:
  * Simplified Chinese `zh-CN`
  * Traditional Chinese `zh-TW`
  * Norwegian Bokm√•l `nb`
  * Swedish `sv`
- Wallabag sharer now targets Wallabag 2 by default. This is potentially breaking change but hopefully, no one uses Wallabag 1 any more. ([#1261](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1261))
- `defaults.ini` file is no longer used, it is only provided for convenience under a new name `config-example.ini` ([#1261](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1261), [#1267](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1267))
- `spout` classes no longer need to implement `Iterator`, instead they should return `Iterator` of newly introduced `Item` objects from `getItems()` method. The types of properties of items have also been revisited. ([#1341](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1341), [#1342](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1342))

- Developers, we are now building the styles and client-side code statically, using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). If you update any such assets, you will need to run `npm run build` for the changes to be reflected. You can also use `npm run dev` to watch for asset changes. ([#1137](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1137))
- Developers, CSS files are now checked using [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) and formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). You can use `npm run lint:styles` and `npm run fix:styles` respectively in the `assets` directory to run those tools. ([#1153](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1153))
- Google+ and del.icio.us share button were removed ([#1121](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1121))

- Setting `DEBUG` to `1` in `src/common.php` no longer logs HTTP bodies, only headers. Set it to `2` if you need the bodies as well. ([#1152](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1152))
- PHP startup errors are now logged, instead of having F3 crash with Error 500 ([#1195](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1195))
- In order to support offline mode, we moved much of the UI to the browser. ([#1150](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1150), [#1184](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1184), [#1215](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1215), [#1216](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1216))
- We carried out a significant internal refactoring ([#1164](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1164), [#1190](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1190))
- Removed Instapaper spout since it has been broken since its acquisition. Sources using it were migrated to ‚ÄúRSS Feed (with content extraction)‚Äù. ([#1245](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1245))
- Placeholders are now used for images before they are loaded to avoid content jumping around ([#1204](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1204))

- Button for opening articles, tags, sources and filters in the sidebar, as well as the source and tag links in articles are now real links, allowing to open them in a new tab by middle-clicking them. ([#1216](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/issues/1216), [#695](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/issues/695))
- The way `config.ini` is parsed has changed. If you use any of the following characters `?{}|&~!()^"`, e.g. for database password, you will need to quote the config value like `db_password="life0fD4ng3r!"`. This is a consequence of replacing F3 framework with [PHP‚Äôs built-in INI parser](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-ini-file.php). ([#1261](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/pull/1261))
